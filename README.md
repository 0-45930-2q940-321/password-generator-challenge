# Password Generator Challenge

## Big thanks to czuar#4780 (https://github.com/SyedAli310) for helping me round it out and fixing the errors



### **What I had to do:**
  - I had to make variables with arrays for uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers.
    - I had to declare global variables so I can assign them into the functions.
      - I had to make a function then assign the global variabls as prompts with an if statement.
        - I had to make a function to randomize arrays.
          - I had to make a function to generate the password, the password having whatever option being true.

   #### I go more indepth in the code comments.
